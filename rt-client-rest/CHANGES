Revision history for Perl module RT::Client::REST

0.42
  Miquel Ruiz <mruiz@cpan.org>
  - Added support for groups via new class RT::Client::REST::Group
    Tests and examples also added.
  Roman Plesll <RPLESSL@cpan.org>
  - Fix for ticket merges

0.41
  Tomas Doran <bobtfish@bobtfish.net>
 - Make version number a string to avoid length of version number changing
   at 0.X0 releases (as this breaks distro packages)
 - Update META.yml to the 0.4 META spec.
 - Include repository metadata to make it easier for people to contribute
   to the module.
 - Change from ExtUtils::MakeMaker to Module::Install (I'm sure you can
   generate the correct information with EU::MM, I just don't know how
   offhand).
 - Add Test::More as a test_requires to help distros which split it out
   of their core perl package (RT#45150)

0.40 
  Jerrad Pierce <jpierce@cpan.org>
  - #38710, more user attributes
  - #39868 & #42391, Alter CF parsing to accomodate 3.8 as well as 3.6
	This required tweaks to Forms as well as Object.
  - #38591 & #43844, Add requestor attribute to Ticket so that autoreplies
	are sent to users under RT3.8

    Improvement: reorganized exceptions, made
    RT::Client::REST::Object::Exception a subclass of
    RT::Client::REST::Exception.  What this means is that now any native
    exception thrown by RT::Client::REST code can be caught by catching a
    generic RT::Client::REST::Exception class.  Added tests to ticket and
    attachment tests scripts to verify the behavior.  I have been meaning
    to do this for a while now.

    Fixed an error in RT::Client::REST::Ticket POD.  Bug 36814.

    Thanks to "Sébastien Aperghis-Tramoni" <sebastien@aperghis.net> 

  - Fri, 25 Jan 2008 "Damien Krotkine" <dams@cpan.org>
    Add dirty custom fields handling. Without it, cf are always submitted,
    included void ones, which may (and does on rt.cpan.org) conflict with
    custom fields rules on the server (e.g. a custom field value cannot be
    empty)

0.32    Sun Dec 23 2007 "Dmitri Tikhonov" <dtikhonov@yahoo.com>
  - Fixed bug 31827 -- allow to specify custom fields at creation time.
    Method 'cf' can now take a hash reference that has a list of custom
    fields and their values.

  - Fixed bug 31828: allow to specify ticket content at creation time.
    Methods RT::Client::REST->create and RT::Client::REST::Ticket->store
    now take optional 'text' parameter.
