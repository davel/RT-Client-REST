=head1 NAME

RT::Client::REST::Transaction -- this object represents a transaction.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $transactions = $ticket->transactions;

  my $count = $transactions->count;
  print "There are $count transactions.\n";

  my $iterator = $transactions->get_iterator;
  while (my $tr = &$iterator) {
      print "Id: ", $tr->id, "; Type: ", $tr->type, "\n";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A transaction is a second-class citizen, as it does not exist (at least
from the current REST protocol implementation) by itself.  At the moment,
it is always associated with a ticket (see B<parent_id> attribute).
Thus, you will
rarely retrieve a transaction by itself; instead, you should use
C<transactions()> method of L<RT::Client::REST::Ticket> object to get
an iterator for all (or some) transactions for that ticket.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item B<id>

Numeric ID of the transaction.

=item B<creator>

Username of the user who created the transaction.

=item B<parent_id>

Numeric ID of the object the transaction is associated with.

=item B<type>

Type of the transactions.  Please referer to L<RT::Client::REST>
documentation for the list of transaction types you can expect this
field to contain.  Note that there may be some transaction types not
(dis)covered yet.

=item B<old_value>

Old value.

=item B<new_value>

New value.

=item B<field>

Name of the field the transaction is describing (if any).

=item B<attachments>

I have never seen it set to anything yet.  (I will some day investigate this).

=item B<created>

Time when the transaction was created.

=item B<content>

Actual content of the transaction.

=item B<description>

Human-readable description of the transaction as provided by RT.

=item B<data>

Not sure what this is yet.

=back

=head1 METHODS

B<RT::Client::REST::Transaction> is a read-only object, so you cannot
C<store()> it.  Also, because it is a second-class citizen, you cannot
C<search()> or C<count()> it -- use C<transactions()> method provided
by L<RT::Client::REST::Ticket>.

=over 2

=item retrieve

To retrieve a transaction, attributes B<id> and B<parent_id> must be set.

=back

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

=over 2

=item B<rt_type>

Returns 'transaction'.
