=head1 NAME

RT::Client::REST::Ticket -- this object represents a ticket.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $rt = RT::Client::REST->new(server => $ENV{RTSERVER});

  # Create a new ticket:
  my $ticket = RT::Client::REST::Ticket->new(
    rt => $rt,
    queue => "General",
    subject => $subject,
  )->store(text => "This is the initial text of the ticket");
  print "Created a new ticket, ID ", $ticket->id, "\n";

  # Update
  my $ticket = RT::Client::REST::Ticket->new(
    rt  => $rt,
    id  => $id,
    priority => 10,
  )->store;

  # Retrieve
  my $ticket => RT::Client::REST::Ticket->new(
    rt => $rt,
    id => $id,
  )->retrieve;

  unless ($ticket->owner eq $me) {
    $ticket->steal;     # Give me more work!
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<RT::Client::REST::Ticket> is based on L<RT::Client::REST::Object>.
The representation allows to retrieve, edit, comment on, and create
tickets in RT.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item B<id>

This is the numeric ID of the ticket.

=item B<queue>

This is the B<name> of the queue (not numeric id).

=item B<owner>

Username of the owner.

=item B<creator>

Username of RT user who created the ticket.

=item B<subject>

Subject of the ticket.

=item B<status>

The status is usually one of the following: "new", "open", "resolved",
"stalled", "rejected", and "deleted".  However, custom RT installations
sometimes add their own statuses.

=item B<priority>

Ticket priority.  Usually a numeric value.

=item B<initial_priority>

=item B<final_priority>

=item B<requestor>

This is the attribute for setting the requestor on ticket creation.
If you use requestors to do this in 3.8, the recipient may not receive
an autoreply from RT because the ticket is initially created as the user
your REST session is connected as.

It is a list attribute (for explanation of list attributes, see
B<LIST ATTRIBUTE PROPERTIES> in L<RT::Client::REST::Object>). 

=item B<requestors>

This contains e-mail addresses of the requestors.

It is a list attribute (for explanation of list attributes, see
B<LIST ATTRIBUTE PROPERTIES> in L<RT::Client::REST::Object>). 

=item B<cc>

A list of e-mail addresses used to notify people of 'correspond'
actions.

=item B<admin_cc>

A list of e-mail addresses used to notify people of all actions performed
on a ticket.

=item B<created>

Time at which ticket was created. Note that this is an immutable field
and therefore the value cannot be changed..

=item B<starts>

=item B<started>

=item B<due>

=item B<resolved>

=item B<told>

=item B<time_estimated>

=item B<time_worked>

=item B<time_left>

=item B<last_updated>

=back

=head2 Attributes storing a time

The attributes which store a time stamp have an additional accessor with the
suffix C<_datetime> (eg., C<resolved_datetime>).  This allows you can get and
set the stored value as a DateTime object.  Internally, it is converted into
the date-time string which RT uses, which is assumed to be in UTC.

=head1 DB METHODS

For full explanation of these, please see B<"DB METHODS"> in
L<RT::Client::REST::Object> documentation.

=over 2

=item B<retrieve>

Retrieve RT ticket from database.

=item B<store ([text =E<gt> $text])>

Create or update the ticket.  When creating a new ticket, optional 'text'
parameter can be supplied to set the initial text of the ticket.

=item B<search>

Search for tickets that meet specific conditions.

=back

=head1 TICKET-SPECIFIC METHODS

=over 2

=item B<comment> (message => $message, %opts)

Comment on this ticket with message $message.  C<%opts> is a list of
key-value pairs as follows:

=over 2

=item B<attachments>

ticket along with the comment.

=item B<cc>

List of e-mail addresses to send carbon copies to (an array reference).

=item B<bcc>

List of e-mail addresses to send blind carbon copies to (an array
reference).

=back

=item B<correspond> (message => $message, %opts)

Add correspondence to the ticket.  Takes exactly the same arguments
as the B<comment> method above.

=cut

# comment and correspond are really the same method, so we save ourselves
# some duplication here.
for my $method (qw(comment correspond)) {
    no strict 'refs';

        my $self = shift;

            %opts,
        );

        return;
    };
}

=item B<attachments>

Get attachments associated with this ticket.  What is returned is an
object of type L<RT::Client::REST::SearchResult> which can then be used
to get at objects of type L<RT::Client::REST::Attachment>.

=cut

sub attachments {
    my $self = shift;

                rt => $self->rt,
            );
        },
    );
}

=item B<transactions>

Get transactions associated with this ticket.  Optionally, you can specify
exactly what types of transactions you want listed, for example:

  my $result = $ticket->transactions(type => [qw(Comment Correspond)]);

Please reference L<RT::Client::REST> documentation for the full list of
valid transaction types.

Return value is an object of type L<RT::Client::REST::SearchResult> which
can then be used to iterate over transaction objects
(L<RT::Client::REST::Transaction>).

    my $self = shift;

=head1 CUSTOM FIELDS

This class inherits 'cf' method from L<RT::Client::REST::Object>.  To create
a ticket with a bunch of custom fields, use the following approach:

  RT::Client::REST::Ticket->new(
    rt => $rt,
    # blah blah
    cf => {
      'field one' => $value1,
      'field two' => $another_value,
    },
  )->store;

Some more examples:

  # Update a custom field value:
  $ticket->cf('field one' => $value1);
  $ticket->store;

  # Get a custom field value:
  my $another value = $ticket->cf('field two');

  # Get a list of ticket's custom field names:
  my @custom_fields = $ticket->cf;
