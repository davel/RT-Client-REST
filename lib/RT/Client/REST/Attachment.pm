=head1 NAME

RT::Client::REST::Attachment -- this object represents an attachment.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $attachments = $ticket->attachments;

  my $count = $attachments->count;
  print "There are $count attachments.\n";

  my $iterator = $attachments->get_iterator;
  while (my $att = &$iterator) {
      print "Id: ", $att->id, "; Subject: ", $att->subject, "\n";
  }

=head1 DESCRIPTION

An attachment is a second-class citizen, as it does not exist (at least
from the current REST protocol implementation) by itself.  At the moment,
it is always associated with a ticket (see B<parent_id> attribute).
Thus, you will
rarely retrieve an attachment by itself; instead, you should use
C<attachments()> method of L<RT::Client::REST::Ticket> object to get
an iterator for all attachments for that ticket.

=head1 ATTRIBUTES

=over 2

=item B<id>

Numeric ID of the attachment.

=item B<creator_id>

Numeric ID of the user who created the attachment.

=item B<parent_id>

Numeric ID of the object the attachment is associated with.  This is not
a proper attribute of the attachment as specified by REST -- it is simply
to store the ID of the L<RT::Client::REST::Ticket> object this attachment
belongs to.

=item B<subject>

Subject of the attachment.

=item B<content_type>

Content type.

=item B<file_name>

File name (if any).

=item B<transaction_id>

Numeric ID of the L<RT::Client::REST::Transaction> object this attachment
is associated with.

=item B<message_id>

Message ID.

=item B<created>

Time when the attachment was created

=item B<content>

Actual content of the attachment.

=item B<headers>

Headers (not parsed), if any.

=item B<parent>

Parent (not sure what this is yet).

=item B<content_encoding>

Content encoding, if any.

=back

=head1 METHODS

B<RT::Client::REST::Attachment> is a read-only object, so you cannot
C<store()> it.  Also, because it is a second-class citizen, you cannot
C<search()> or C<count()> it -- use C<attachments()> method provided
by L<RT::Client::REST::Ticket>.

=over 2

=item retrieve

To retrieve an attachment, attributes B<id> and B<parent_id> must
be set.

=back

=head1 INTERNAL METHODS

=over 2

=item B<rt_type>

Returns 'attachment'.
