This is a TODO file.  I will be checking things off as they get
implemented.

- Fetch forms from RT and verify CFs etc. based on that on the client
  side because of RT REST's non-atomicity -- i.e. some fields/values
  will go through correctly, while others will give syntax/permission
  errors.

  Based on discussion with Jesse Vincent (obra) on #rt@irc.perl.org
  on 7/25/2006.

- Write user manual.
